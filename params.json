I've been curious about coding and tech for a while now, and recently decided to take it up and see if I can learn a bit. I'm really interested in the ways that tech affects and integrates with everyday life. \r\n\r\n## Past projects\r\nHackPrinceton 2016: This was my first hackathon - I was very intimidated so I decided to make a motivation generator with my friend. We made a website that automatically generated encouragements for other students \r\nHack the North 2016: I made a webform that collected information about who people wanted to contact (phone #, message) and used Scale API to outsource the user call and collected the response using node.js to listen for incoming JSON's. We then used SendGrid to produce a email back to the user. \r\n\r\n## Pipeline \r\n\r\nI'm thinking of building an app that is like Shazam, but works for humming. The primary objective of the app will be to help users search for songs without lyrics that are stuck in their heads. I'm thinking that the app will reference the changes in tones that a user hums against a library. It'll be an interesting project as I haven't worked with audio data before! ",
